"mdl"      model file (required)
"noise"    sound file for the pickup sound (default is per worldtype)
"skin"     skin index (default 0)

The "keyname" value is used both for the pickup message and to associate
the key with the entity that it unlocks.

To make a func_door or trigger_usekey require this key, set the
"keyname" value of that entity so that it matches the "keyname" value of
the key.

If different item_key_custom entities have the same "keyname" value,
they will be treated as different copies of the same key and may be used
interchangeably.

A map may have a maximum of 23 unique "keyname" values across all
entities.

The behavior of an item_key_custom should be as the player expects
(based on the behavior of the silver and gold keys), except for the fact
that it will not appear as an icon in the player's status bar when
picked up.  This is a limitation of the engine.

Scale the fade distance of the light by "n". Values of n > 1 make the light fade more quickly with distance, and values < 1 make the light fade more slowly (and thus reach further). Default 1.

"delay" "n"
Select an attenuation formaula for the light:
0 => Linear attenuation (default)
1 => 1/x attenuation
2 => 1/(x^2) attenuation
3 => No attenuation (same brightness at any distance)
4 => "local minlight" - No attenuation and like minlight,
it won�t raise the lighting above it�s light value.
Unlike minlight, it will only affect surfaces within
line of sight of the entity.
5 => 1/(x^2) attenuation, but slightly more attenuated and
without the extra bright effect that "delay 2" has
near the source.

"_falloff" "n"
Sets the distance at which the light drops to 0, in map units.
In this mode, "wait" is ignored and "light" only controls the brightness at the center of the light, and no longer affects the falloff distance.
Only supported on linear attenuation (delay 0) lights currently.

"_color" "r g b"
Specify red(r), green(g) and blue(b) components for the colour of the light. RGB component values are between 0 and 255 (between 0 and 1 is also accepted). Default is white light ("255 255 255").

"target" "name"
Turns the light into a spotlight, with the direction of light being towards another entity with it�s "targetname" key set to "name".
"mangle" "yaw pitch roll"
Turns the light into a spotlight and specifies the direction of light using yaw, pitch and roll in degrees. Yaw specifies the angle around the Z-axis from 0 to 359 degrees and pitch specifies the angle from 90 (straight up) to -90 (straight down). Roll has no effect, so use any value (e.g. 0). Often easier than the "target" method.

"angle" "n"
Specifies the angle in degrees for a spotlight cone. Default 40.

"_softangle" "n"
Specifies the angle in degrees for an inner spotlight cone (must be less than the "angle" cone. Creates a softer transition between the full brightness of the inner cone to the edge of the outer cone. Default 0 (disabled).

"targetname" "name"
Turns the light into a switchable light, toggled by another entity targeting it�s name.

"speed" "n"
If the light is switchable and FADE_IN_OUT is set, the speed at which the light transitions. Default 0.1.

"style" "n"
Set the animated light style. Default 0.

"style2" "n"
Set the animated light style for a switchable light, because style will be overriden if a targetname is set. Default 0.

"_anglescale" "n" | "_anglesense" "n"
Sets a scaling factor for how much influence the angle of incidence of light on a surface has on the brightness of the surface. n must be between 0.0 and 1.0. Smaller values mean less attenuation, with zero meaning that angle of incidence has no effect at all on the brightness. Default 0.5.

"_dirtscale" "n" | "_dirtgain" "n"
Override the global "_dirtscale" or "_dirtgain" settings to change how this light is affected by dirtmapping (ambient occlusion). See descriptions of these keys in the worldspawn section.

"_dirt" "n"
Overrides the worldspawn setting of "_dirt" for this particular light. -1 to disable dirtmapping (ambient occlusion) for this light, making it illuminate the dirtmapping shadows. 1 to enable ambient occlusion for this light. Default is to defer to the worldspawn setting.

"_deviance" "n"
Split up the light into a sphere of randomly positioned lights within radius "n" (in world units). Useful to give shadows a wider penumbra. "_samples" specifies the number of lights in the sphere. The "light" value is automatically scaled down for most lighting formulas (except linear and non-additive minlight) to attempt to keep the brightness equal. Default is 0, do not split up lights.

"_samples" "n"
Number of lights to use for "_deviance". Default 16 (only used if "_deviance" is set).

"_surface" "texturename"
Makes surfaces with the given texture name emit light, by using this light as a template which is copied across those surfaces. Lights are spaced about 128 units (though possibly closer due to bsp splitting) apart and positioned 2 units above the surfaces.

"_surface_offset" "n"
Controls the offset lights are placed above surfaces for "_surface". Default 2.

"_surface_spotlight" "n"
For a surface light template (i.e. a light with "_surface" set), setting this to "1" makes each instance into a spotlight, with the direction of light pointing along the surface normal. In other words, it automatically sets "mangle" on each of the generated lights.

"_project_texture" "texture"
Specifies that a light should project this texture. The texture must be used in the map somewhere.

"_project_mangle" "yaw pitch roll"
Specifies the yaw/pitch/roll angles for a texture projection (overriding mangle).

"_project_fov" "n"
Specifies the fov angle for a texture projection. Default 90.

"_bouncescale" "n"
Scales the amount of light that is contributed by bounces. Default is 1.0, 0.0 disables bounce lighting for this light.

"_sun" "n"
Set to 1 to make this entity a sun, as an alternative to using the sunlight worldspawn keys. If the light targets an info_null entity, the direction towards that entity sets sun direction. The light itself is disabled, so it can be placed anywhere in the map.

The following light properties correspond to these sunlight settings:
light => _sunlight
mangle => _sunlight_mangle
deviance => _sunlight_penumbra
_color => _sunlight_color
_dirt => _sunlight_dirt
_anglescale => _anglescale

--------------
DN_N_WAIT is a plat that starts at the top and when triggered, goes down, waits, then comes back up.
health - number of seconds to wait (default 5)

--------------
PLT_TOGGLE is a plat that will change between the top and bottom each time it is triggered.

--------------
ELEVATOR is an elevator plat. You can have as many levels as you want but they must be all the same distance away. Use elevator button entity as the trigger.
  cnt is the number of floors
  height is the distance between floors
  wait is the number of seconds before the elevator can be activated again after starting or stopping (default 0)

START_AT_TOP is an optional flag for elevators. It just tells the elevator that it's position is the top floor. (Default is the bottom floor) USE THIS ONLY WITH ELEVATORS!

--------------
PLAT2 is a fixed version of the original plat. If you want the plat to start at the bottom and move to the top on demand, use a negative height. That will tell Quake to lower the plat at spawn time. Always place this plat type in the top position when making the map. This will ensure correct lighting, hopefully. If a plat2 is the target of a trigger, it will be disabled until it has been triggered. Delay is the wait before the plat returns to original position.

If you don't want to bother figuring out the height, don't put a
value in the height

delay		default 3
speed		default 150
cnt			default 2

P2_BOTTOM is an optional switch to have an auto-sized plat2 start at the bottom.
--------------
Plats are always drawn in the extended position, so they will light correctly.

If the plat is the target of another trigger or button, it will start out disabled in the extended position until it is trigger, when it will lower and become a normal plat.

Shoots particles either when triggered, or contiuously when not triggered by anything.
"color" is the palette color of the particles

"count" is the number of particles to make each time

"delay" is the delay between each triggering

"noise" is the name of the wav file to play when triggered

"movedir" is the vector distance that the particles will travel before disappearing. (in x y z)

"duration" is the amount of time that the it will continue to release particles so that it can release a long stream of particles with only one triggering.*/

/*QUAKED func_rotate_entity (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) TOGGLE START_ON
Creates an entity that continually rotates.  Can be toggled on and
off if targeted.

TOGGLE = allows the rotation to be toggled on/off

START_ON = wether the entity is spinning when spawned.  If TOGGLE is 0, entity can be turned on, but not off.

If "deathtype" is set with a string, this is the message that will appear when a player is killed by the train.

"rotate" is the rate to rotate.
"target" is the center of rotation.
"speed"  is how long the entity takes to go from standing still to full speed and vice-versa.

/*QUAKED path_rotate (0.5 0.3 0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) ROTATION ANGLES STOP NO_ROTATE DAMAGE MOVETIME SET_DAMAGE
 Path for rotate_train.

 ROTATION tells train to rotate at rate specified by "rotate".  Use '0 0 0' to stop rotation.

 ANGLES tells train to rotate to the angles specified by "angles" while traveling to this path_rotate.  Use values < 0 or > 360 to guarantee that it turns in a certain direction.  Having this flag set automatically clears any rotation.

 STOP tells the train to stop and wait to be retriggered.

 NO_ROTATE tells the train to stop rotating when waiting to be triggered.

 DAMAGE tells the train to cause damage based on "dmg".

 MOVETIME tells the train to interpret "speed" as the length of time to take moving from one corner to another.

 SET_DAMAGE tells the train to set all targets damage to "dmg"

 "noise" contains the name of the sound to play when train stops.
 "noise1" contains the name of the sound to play when train moves.
 "event" is a target to trigger when train arrives at path_rotate.
*/
/*QUAKED func_rotate_train (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
In path_rotate, set speed to be the new speed of the train after it reaches
the path change.  If speed is -1, the train will warp directly to the next
path change after the specified wait time.  If MOVETIME is set on the
path_rotate, the train to interprets "speed" as the length of time to
take moving from one corner to another.

"noise" contains the name of the sound to play when train stops.
"noise1" contains the name of the sound to play when train moves.
Both "noise" and "noise1" defaults depend upon "sounds" variable and
can be overridden by the "noise" and "noise1" variable in path_rotate.

Also in path_rotate, if STOP is set, the train will wait until it is
retriggered before moving on to the next goal.

Trains are moving platforms that players can ride.
"path" specifies the first path_rotate and is the starting position.
If the train is the target of a button or trigger, it will not begin moving until activated.
The func_rotate_train entity is the center of rotation of all objects targeted by it.

If "deathtype" is set with a string, this is the message that will appear when a player is killed by the train.

/*QUAKED func_movewall (0 .5 .8) ? VISIBLE TOUCH NONBLOCKING
Used to emulate collision on rotating objects.

VISIBLE causes brush to be displayed.

TOUCH specifies whether to cause damage when touched by player.

NONBLOCKING makes the brush non-solid.  This is useless if VISIBLE is set.

"dmg" specifies the damage to cause when touched or blocked.

/*QUAKED func_rotate_door (0 .5 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) STAYOPEN
Creates a door that rotates between two positions around a point of
rotation each time it's triggered.

STAYOPEN tells the door to reopen after closing.  This prevents a trigger-
once door from closing again when it's blocked.

"dmg" specifies the damage to cause when blocked.  Defaults to 2.  Negative numbers indicate no damage.
"speed" specifies how the time it takes to rotate
